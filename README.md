## Challenges Faced

1. In the API call, there is no specific time and day-related field like tomorrow and today. Therefore, I didn't include it in the app. 
   
2. In the API call, the title and description are the same. Also, in the UI, there is no separate title and description. Therefore, I have included only the title.
